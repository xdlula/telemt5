- Display Note: This application was developed in early 2022 using an older version of PyQt5. Due to updates in PyQt5 since then, you may notice some display issues such as misaligned designs, oversized text, or other visual inconsistencies. These do not affect the core functionality of the application but may impact its appearance.
